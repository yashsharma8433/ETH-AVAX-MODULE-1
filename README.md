# Smart Contract using Solidity

A smart contract is a self-executing computer program that automatically checks and enforces  the terms of a contract or agreement. It has been implemented in blockchain platforms such as Solidity for Ethereum. 
Solidity is a programming language specifically designed to write smart contracts for Ethereum and other compatible blockchain platforms. It is a statically typed language with features similar to JavaScript and C, but with some unique features to handle blockchain-specific operations and interactions.

# Module-1: Error Handling using Solidity

Error handling in Solidity involves dealing with exceptions or errors that may occur during the execution of a smart contract. This Solidity smart contract demonstrates error handling techniques using the require, assert, and revert statements. 

# Purpose

Different error handling techniques in Solidity:
1. require(): This require statement is typically used to validate input conditions or contract preconditions. It throws an error and reverts the transaction if the condition is not met.
2. assert(): The assert statement is used to check for internal errors in the contract. It should only be used for conditions that should never be false. If the condition is false, it indicates a bug in the contract.
3. revert(): The revert statement is used to explicitly revert the transaction, usually due to a requirement violation or an exceptional condition.

These error handling mechanisms help ensure the contract's integrity and provide meaningful feedback to users interacting with the contract. Carefully validating inputs, handling exceptional conditions, and providing meaningful error messages can help prevent unexpected behavior and improve the overall robustness of the contract.
